# Waduzitdo-Py
A translation of the interpreter for the Waduzitdo language into python, usable on windows.

# About Waduzitdo:
WADUZITDO: How To Write a Language in 256 Words or Less' has been the title of an article from BYTE magazine, September 1978 issue (pp. 166-175), by Larry Kheriarty, describing a very minimalistic language to show off 'what a computer can do', intended to catch attention from even a complete computer iliterate.

WADUZITDO is a rough PILOT descendant, following a very simple [<Modifier>*] <Operation> ":" <Data> structure, where every line is a single instruction to the computer.
This implementation is rather straight forward, modelled after the 6800 Assembly language version as authoritative source, thus honoring all embedded quirks.
(DESCRIPTION TAKEN OVER FROM waduzitdo.org)
Original Implementation by Larry Kheriarty in 1978.
Original interpreter in JavaScript written by Hans Franke in JavaScript and HTML.

Special thanks to Tyler Zahnke for introducing me to this language and giving me the needed info.
